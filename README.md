# TicTacToe
2 player TicTacToe first version  0.1

Basic idea is to create a command line Tic Tac Toe game that 2 player can play on same computer 
This is version 0.1 of game , in version 0.2 i will imporove code (use list instead of global variable ...) ,add a Tkinter GUI 

The code may not be the most efficient code but its working fine and i am trying to create a better algo for TicTacToe

mail me if you want to lend hands sajjads26@gmail.com


What  can be added to make this program better and user friendly ?

sound of clap |  a tkinter GUI   | code efficinely can be increased
