# TicTacToe
2 player TicTacToeversion  0.2

Basic idea is to create a command line Tic Tac Toe game that 2 player can play on same computer 
This is version 0.2 of game , in version 0.3 i will imporove code  ,add a Tkinter GUI 

The code may not be the most efficient code but its working fine and i am trying to create a better algo for TicTacToe

What  can be added to make this program better and user friendly ?

sound of clap |  a tkinter GUI   | code efficinely can be improved
